## Contributing a Template

We have a high quality bar for merging templates. Focus on quality over quantity.

Want to add a template? Open a PR that adds a new folder to this directory.

### PR Requirements

Your PR must include:

1. **A new folder** in `community/templates/` named after your template (e.g., `community/templates/remix-clerk-starter/`)
2. **Working code** that runs with `npm install && npm run dev` from within the template folder
3. **README.md** inside your template folder with:
   - What the template demonstrates
   - Setup instructions
   - Screenshot or GIF (upload to GitHub by dragging into the PR, then use that link)
4. **Video demo** - Link to a short video demo in the README and PR description. You can [upload videos directly to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/attaching-files) by dragging into a comment, then copy the generated link.

### Keep It Simple

Templates should be focused and minimal:

- **Starters, not showcases** - Templates should be minimal enough that someone can take it and build something completely different. If you've built a polished app with lots of demo UI, strip it down to the essentials before submitting.
- **1-3 technologies** is ideal. A template showing "Next.js + Clerk + Tambo" is better than one with 8 different libraries.
- **One tool per job** - pick ONE auth provider, ONE database, ONE styling solution. Templates with multiple options for the same thing will be rejected.
- **Minimal dependencies** - only include what's necessary to demonstrate the integration.
- **Small, readable files** - If your main App file is doing too much, break it up or simplify. Templates should be easy to understand at a glance.
- **Clean code** - no commented-out code, no unused files, no placeholder TODOs, no hardcoded user names or demo data.

### Code Quality

Your template must include linting and type checking appropriate for its stack, and it must pass. Before submitting:

```bash
npm run lint      # Must pass with no errors
npm run typecheck # Must pass with no errors (if using TypeScript)
npm run build     # Must complete successfully
```

Templates should include:

- **Linting configuration** - Include linting with sensible defaults for the technologies in your template (ESLint is recommended for JS/TS stacks). Most of the Tambo repo uses [our base config](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo/blob/main/packages/eslint-config/base.mjs) as a reference point, but templates are not required to use it. Anything materially looser in style/consistency is unlikely to be accepted.
- **TypeScript strict mode** - Enable `"strict": true` in tsconfig.json
- **No type errors** - Fix all TypeScript errors, don't use `@ts-ignore` or `any` as workarounds

We'll run these checks during review. Templates with lint errors or type issues will be rejected.

### Design Requirements

Design quality should match our [official templates](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-template). Or better. Use them as your reference for the visual bar we expect.

### Tambo Integration

We're not expecting a ton of Tambo code. Just **one example** that proves the integration works:

- **Auth template** - show that auth works with Tambo
- **Database template** - one component that can add or display records via AI
- **Framework template** - existing Tambo components work and are styled correctly in that framework

The video should show a conversation with the AI using your integration. Proper component/tool registration with clear descriptions is required.

**No workarounds** - Your template must use Tambo's actual APIs correctly. If you run into issues getting components to render or tools to work, [open a bug issue](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo/issues/new) and we'll help. Don't hack around problems - templates that bypass Tambo's rendering system will be rejected.

### README Quality

Your template's README must include:

- **One-sentence description** - what this template is for.
- **Screenshot** - showing the app running with Tambo UI visible.
- **Video link** - demonstrating the AI interaction.
- **Prerequisites** - what accounts/API keys are needed (e.g., "You'll need a Clerk account").
- **Setup steps** - numbered, copy-pasteable commands.
- **What's included** - bullet list of the technologies and what they're used for.

### What Gets Rejected

- Lint errors or type checking failures
- Missing ESLint or TypeScript configuration
- Use of `@ts-ignore`, `any`, or disabled lint rules as workarounds
- Kitchen-sink templates that try to include everything
- Overcomplicated "showcase" apps disguised as starters
- Workarounds that bypass Tambo's actual rendering or tool system
- Broken or incomplete setups
- Missing video demo
- Poor documentation
- Ugly or unstyled UI
- Not responsive
- Generic "todo app" without meaningful Tambo integration
- Duplicating an integration we already have without adding something new

### Template Folder Structure

```
community/templates/
├── your-template-name/
│   ├── README.md          # Setup instructions + screenshot

```

### Ideas for Templates

- **Frameworks** - Remix, Expo, Astro, or other React frameworks
- **Auth** - Clerk, Supabase Auth, NextAuth
- **Database** - Prisma, Drizzle, Convex
- **Backend** - tRPC, Hono
- **Use cases** - Real-time apps, dashboards, specific domains
